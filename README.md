# 🏋️ Dotnet Bootcamp

Welcome to Dotnet Bootcamp 👋.

This project is intended to help you learn `dotnet` step by step through a series of carefully thought out levels. Each level will require you
to write code until the tests in the level pass. By default, the tests are designed to fail. How you get them to pass is irrelevent. The only rule is that **YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO CHANGE THE TEST**.

## Getting Started

The entire project relies on `git` to work. Apart from forking the repo, each level lives in its own branch. After forking the repo, you need to select the level you want to tackle and then branch off of that branch. When you are done with the level, you must create a pull request back into the level's branch and have your code reviewed by someone you trust.

## Levels

| Level | Branch                                                                                            | Build Status                                                                                                                                   |
